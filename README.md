### Howdy!

My name is Peyton, and I'm a software engineer with a passion for data. 

You can find examples of some of my work, used in production at companies like Progressive, Cisco, and Deliveroo, [here](#examples-of-previous-work).

üåé **Location**

I generally work remotely, but am based out of Durham, North Carolina. I'm always happy to meet people in person!

üèπ **What I'm looking for**

I'm on the hunt for my next role right now. If you work on an awesome team and are looking for your next teammate, I'd love to hear from you. 

**I am especially interested in**
* Backend roles dealing with data-intensive systems
* Backend roles with room for spending a bit of time on the frontend

But a great team beats all of that. Great teams come in all shapes and sizes, but I tend to enjoy regular sync collaboration with teammates, a culture of active code review, and more autonomy than less. 

üíª **Experience Overview**

I've worked in a variety of roles, mostly in Go and Python, and generally on the backend, though I've been known to dabble on the front end too. Most recently I worked at Prefect, a python data orchestration tool, where I built software to allow data scientists and data engineers to run their code in environments like AWS, GCP, and Kubernetes, with support for mixed synchronous, asynchronous, and parallel execution.

Prior to that I was one of the first engineers at a recycling company with a heavy emphasis on data and analytics. Our applications were a combination of Go and Python on the backend, and Angular on the frontend. 

Most of my other work has been contract work in analytics and backend for crypto startups.

### Examples of previous work

These are just a few examples of my contributions, but hopefully they give you an idea of the code that I write and my approach to design.

[Run Prefect flows on serverless infrastructure using Google Cloud Run](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-gcp/pull/48)

This code spins up a GCP Cloud Run Job that executes Prefect code, while maintaining orchestration via the Prefect Server. At the time that I made this, there was only an Open API spec for Cloud Run Jobs. 

[Execute code that is defined in GitHub](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-github/pull/30)

This PR gave Prefect users the ability to orchestrate code that was defined in both public and private GitHub repos.

[Base configuration for designing workers to execute code on any infrastructure](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/pull/8100)

This PR introduces configuration for an experimental workers feature. It allows contributors to design templates for configuring code execution on infrastructure of their choice. The key challenge here was designing the configuration so that it would be ergonomic, compitible with the expectations of users familiar with Pydantic, and arbitrarily extensible.
